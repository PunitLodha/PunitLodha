Hi, I am **Punit Lodha**, a Masters student in Computer Science at Saarland University. Last year, I interned at Emotech where I worked with rust to build a library for media streaming and an API for rendering 3D animations. I was selected as a GSoC student in 2021 with [CCExtractor](https://ccextractor.org/) for a [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5980303367077888) in rust. I have also interned as a frontend developer and an UI/UX designer. Other than that, I have also been exploring [distributed systems](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2020/), compilers. In my free time you'll find me reading books, playing board games, chess, and ricing my linux desktop :)

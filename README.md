Hi, I am **Punit Lodha**, a Masters student in Computer Science at Saarland University. I am currently working on my Master's thesis to improve video streaming quality of experience using partially reliable transport and QUIC. I have experience with rust through my two internships and a Google Summer of Code 21' [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5980303367077888). I also have been a mentor for about 5 years now, first mentoring my juniors in our college coding club DJ Unicode, and later as a mentor for CCExtractor in Google Summer of Code in 2022, 2023 and 2024.

I am open to work as a Software Engineer preferably in the backend, networks, distributed system domains. 

In my free time you'll find me hiking, reading books, playing board games, chess, and ricing my linux desktop :)
